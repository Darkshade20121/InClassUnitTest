# InClassUnitTest

I looked online and it looked like Robot Framework (RF) was a good framework to choose. 
The main difference between the two frameworks is that RF is not an xUnit style testing. 
Both are fairly similar to each other and I think I would be able to replicate the same tests I have made but in RF.
